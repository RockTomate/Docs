title: Root Variables

Root variables are RockTomate's built-in variables that can be used from anywhere. They can be constant or dynamic. Examples would be a project directory path or even the name of a currently running job.

To see all available root variables, click the “Root” tab in "Variable Manager" window. You'll be able to see values of constant root variables right away, but dynamic variables are marked as `<dynamic variable>`.

Right-clicking a variable will let you copy it to the clipboard to save the trouble of typing it manually.
